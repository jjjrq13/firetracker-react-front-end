            <h2>The Kakeibo budgeting method</h2>
            <p>
                Developed by a Japanese female journalist, Kakeibo involves
                writing down all the money you receive and spend, traditionally
                in a journal, but we make it easy for you. This helps us be more
                mindful about how we spend and save money. With Kakeibo, we like
                to start with the following questions:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>How much money do I have?</li>
                <li>How much money do I want to save?</li>
                <li>How much am I spending?</li>
                <li>How can I improve?</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Life can be overwhelming and complicated, but your finances
                donâ€™t have to be. By choosing to be more mindful, we can make
                better choices about spending, reach our financial goals, and
                make saving much easier.
